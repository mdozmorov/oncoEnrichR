Description: oncoEnrichR performs annotation and prioritization of genesets discovered from high-throughput experiments within 
    cancer biology. The tool queries a number of high-quality resources, including Project Score (cellular fitness in genome-scale
    drop-out screens), Open Targets Platform (comprehensive target-drug and target-disease associations), TCGA (genetic aberrations
    and gene expression patterns in human tumor samples), STRING (protein-protein interaction networks), CORUM (curated protein complexes),
    COMPPI (subcellular compartments), and Gene Ontology/MSigDB/REACTOME/KEGG (functional enrichment/over-representation analysis
    with respect to gene function and cellular pathways). The package outputs an interactive HTML report in which the user
    can interrogate the the various types of annotations and analyses performed with the geneset.
