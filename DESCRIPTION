Description: oncoEnrichR performs annotation and prioritization of genesets discovered from high-throughput experiments in 
    cancer biology. The tool queries a number of high-quality resources, including Project Score (cellular fitness in genome-scale
    drop-out screens), Open Targets Platform (comprehensive target-drug and target-disease associations), TCGA (genetic aberrations
    and gene expression patterns in tumor samples), STRING (protein-protein interaction networks), CORUM (protein complexes),
    COMPPI (subcellular compartments), and Gene Ontology/MSigDB/REACTOME/KEGG (functional enrichment/over-representation analysis
    with respect to gene function and cellular pathways)
Depends: 
    R (>= 3.5)
Imports: tidyverse (>= 1.3.0), visNetwork (>= 2.0.8), plotly (>= 4.9.1), pals (>= 1.5)
