Description: oncoEnrichR performs annotation and prioritization of genesets 
    discovered from high-throughput experiments within cancer biology. The tool 
    queries a number of high-quality resources, including Project Score 
    (cellular fitness in genome-scale drop-out screens), Open Targets Platform 
    (comprehensive target-drug and target-disease associations), TCGA (genetic 
    aberrations and gene expression patterns in human tumor samples), STRING 
    (protein-protein interaction networks), CORUM (curated protein complexes),
    COMPPI (subcellular compartments), Human Protein Atlas (tissue and cell-type 
    specific expression patterns and prognostic associations), and 
    Gene Ontology/MSigDB/REACTOME/KEGG (functional enrichment/over-representation 
    analysis with respect to gene function and cellular pathways). The package 
    outputs both an interactive HTML report and an Excel workbook in which the user can interrogate 
    the various types of annotations and analyses performed with the geneset.
