### TCGA co-expression (RNAseq)

* Using RNA-seq data from TCGA, a co-expression correlation matrix (Pearson rank correlation coefficent) was calculated, indicating pairs of genes that have their expression patterns correlated in tumors
* Here, we are showing, across the main primary tumor sites:
  1) Genes with a **very strong** correlation (negative or positive) to genes in the target set
  2) Tumor suppressor genes or proto-oncogenes with a **strong/very strong** correlation (negative or positive) to genes in the target set
