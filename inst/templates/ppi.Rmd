### Protein-protein interaction network

* The target set is queried against known protein-protein interactions, as evident from the [STRING database (v11)](http://string-db.org)
  * Note that interactions in STRING are assembled from multiple sources, including co-expression, co-occurrence in the literature, experimental data, curated databases etc
  * In addition to potential interactions within the target set, the network is expanded with n = `r gene_enrich_report[['ppi']][['stringdb']][['settings']][['add_nodes']] ` proteins that interact with a protein in the target set (this number can be modified)
  * Network is restricted to interactions of high confidence (STRING association score > 900 (range 0-1000))

* Network legend:
  * Target set proteins are **circles**, other interacting proteins are **rectangles** (note that sizes of nodes do not carry any value)
  * Tumor suppressor genes (annotated from [CancerMine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0422-y)) are highlighted in <span style="color:firebrick"><b>red</b></span>
  * Proto-oncogenes (annotated from [CancerMine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0422-y)) are highligted in <span style="color:darkolivegreen"><b>green</b></span>
  * Genes predicted to have a dual role as proto-oncogenes/tumor suppressors (annotated from [CancerMine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0422-y)) are highligted in <span style="color:black"><b>black</b></span>
