### Gene co-expression (non-diseased tissue)

* Using publicly available RNA-seq counts from [>18,000 samples in 53 human tissue types (GTex)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-5214/Results), a co-expression correlation matrix was calculated
* Indication of the degree to which pairs of genes have their expression patterns correlated in human tissues (non-disease)
* Here, we are showing, across the main human tissue types:
   * Pairs of proteins in the target sets with a **very strong**/**strong**/**moderate** correlation (either negative or positive), i.e. r > 0.4 or r < -0.4
   * Pairs with weak, very weak, or non-significant correlations are shown as *NA*
